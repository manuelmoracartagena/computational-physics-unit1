# computational-physics-unit1
Some physics-related code I developed in the Computational Physics course at Universidad de Alicante. It provided excellent practice with Python libraries such as Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. This repository corresponds to unit 1.
unit1.pdf is a detailed description of what each of the codes does.
